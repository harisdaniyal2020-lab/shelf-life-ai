# ShelfLife AI - Smart Household Hub

## Elevator Pitch

ShelfLife AI is an intelligent household inventory management system that automatically tracks food, toiletries, and cleaning supplies across your entire home. Using smart barcode scanning, receipt analysis, and AI-powered expiry predictions, it eliminates waste, prevents emergency shopping trips, and saves families hundreds of dollars annually. Never wonder "do we have that?" again—ShelfLife knows exactly what's in your pantry, fridge, bathroom, and garage, alerting you before items expire or run out. It's like having a personal assistant for your household essentials.
